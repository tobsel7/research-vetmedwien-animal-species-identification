# Animal Species Identification

This research deals with animal identification algorithms used to monitor wildlife
animals with computation-enabled camera traps.

The reproducibility experiment is based on a 
[paper by Carl et al.](http://doi.org/10.1007/s10344-020-01404-y)

The executed reproducibility experiment is available as a [website](https://tobsel7.github.io/research-vetmedwien-animal-species-identification/reproducibility-experiment-carl/)
and [source code](reproducibility-experiment-animal-identification-carl.ipynb).
