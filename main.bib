abstract = {We present an energy-efficient and practical solution for adding edge intelligence to camera traps, that aims to make remote monitoring and timely detection of wildlife more feasible. Using a hardware-software co-design approach and low-cost, commercially available, off-the-shelf components, our system has been designed to last for months in the field on a small battery pack, while providing accurate edge intelligence and on-board communication functionality to existing camera trap deployments. Our hardware is compatible with most trail cameras while our embedded edge inference pipeline can be run effectively using the limited computing resources and energy budget on-board. Our prototype has currently been deployed for remote monitoring of wild felids - mountain lions and bobcats - serving the needs of a wild cat research and conservation effort in Northern California and is the outcome of a collaboration between conservation efforts, trained project team members and volunteers, and a `maker culture' approach to affordable and open-source technology solutions for the planet.},
